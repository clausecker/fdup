In order to build fdup, tweak the settings in src/Makefile and then call

	make all

in the top-level directory. This creates a directory proto which contains all
the files that will later be installed. Next, you can install fdup with

	make PREFIX=### install

where PREFIX is the pefix fdup will be installed to. If no PREFIX is given, it
defaults to /usr/local.

To create a source tarball for redistribution from the git repository, call

	make tarball

this generates a source tarball named fdup-###.tar.gz where ### is a string
describing the version of fdup bundled in the tarball.
