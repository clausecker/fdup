NAME
       fdup - find duplicates


SYNOPSIS
       fdup directory...


DESCRIPTION
       fdup  traverses the supplied directories and finds file with equal con‐
       tent. fdup then  prints  files  that  were  found  to  have  duplicates
       linewise  to  standard  output.  Groups of equal files are separated by
       blank lines.

       fdup outputs statistics to stderr(3) while processing files. fdup  will
       not follow symbolic links it encounters.


OPTIONS
       none


BUGS
       The program is quite slow as it needs to read every file it encounters.
       Future versions of this program will employ smartes techniques to  com‐
       pare  files. fdup lacks configurability and options. Future version are
       going to have command line options.
