.SH NAME
fdup \- find duplicates

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fdup
.RI [ mode ]
.RI [ option "...]"
.IR directory ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfdup\fR traverses the supplied directories and finds file with equal
contents. \fBfdup\fR outputs statistics to \fBstderr\fR(3) while processing
files. \fBfdup\fR will not follow symbolic links it encounters.

.SH OPTIONS

This utility has three modes of operation. These are selected with the options
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-L\fR and \fB\-S\fR. If none of these options is given,
\fBfdup\fR behaves as if \fB\-S\fR was selected. If more than one mode of
operation is given, only the last mode that was passed counts.

.TP
.B \-H
Turn each group of files with equal contents into hardlinks to one file. This
implies \fB-b \fIl\fR.

.TP
.B \-L
List groups of files with equal contents, separated by blank files.

.TP
.B \-S
Similar to \fB\-H\fR, turn each group of files with equal contents into
symbolic links to one file. The file that is not turned into a symbolic link is
arbitrarily chosen.

.TP
\fB\-b \fIspecifier\fR...
Control file matching behavior. \fIspecifier\fR is one or more of the following
specifiers. By default, \fBfdup\fR considers all cases as duplicate that can be
detected as distinct files with the specifiers below.

.RS
.TP
.B c
Files with different creation times are considered distinct
.TP
.B d
Files on different devices are considered distinct
.TP
.B g
Files owned by different groups are considered distinct
.TP
.B l
Hardlinks to the same file are considered distinct
.TP
.B m
Files with different modification times are considered distinct
.TP
.B p
Files with different permissions are considered distinct
.TP
.B u
Files owned by different users are considered distinct

.B \-h
Print a brief help.

.TP
\fB\-s \fIn\fR[,\fIm\fR]
Restrict file size when looking for duplicates. If used in the form \fB\-s
\fIn\fR, \fBfdup\fR ignores all files that are less than \fIn\fR bytes in size.
If used in the form \fB\-s \fIn\fR,\fIm\fR, \fBfdup\fR ignores all files that
are less than \fIn\fR or more than \fIm\fR bytes in size. If you don't want to
specify a lower boundary, use \fB\-s \fI0\fR,\fIm\fR. By default, \fBfdup\fR
behaves as if \fB\-s \fI0\fR has been given.

Suffixes \fIK\fR, \fIM\fR, \fIG\fR, \fIT\fR, \fIP\fR and \fIE\fR can be used
to specify 1024, 1024*1024, 1024*1024*1024 etc. bytes.

This option can speed up operation if you are scanning a large amount of small
files but don't care about duplicates in them, or if you don't want \fBfdup\fR
to scan through very large files that are known not to be duplicates.

.TP
.B \-x
Stay on one file system. This applies to each supplied directory individually.

.SH BUGS
When using the option
.BR \-H ,
.B fdup
is known to have problems when too many files are considered equal
